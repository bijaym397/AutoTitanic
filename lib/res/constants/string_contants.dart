      '''<p>Buying a new car gets you the benefit of the latest advances in safety and security, comfort, performance and fuel efficiency and you'll be able to get just the specification you want.</p>
  <p>Once you've decided which car you want to buy, do some research online so that when you go into the dealership or speak to the vendor you are in a strong position to haggle. Look to see if there are any similar cars for sale elsewhere and compare the prices. Even if you are buying a brand new car, the dealer will have room for manoeuvre on the price.</p>
  <p>Remember there is always room for negotiation when it comes to car prices, especially in the current climate, so decide how much you are prepared to pay for the vehicle (but be realistic) and stick to your guns. Be prepared to walk away though if this price isn't agreed - with a bit of luck you'll get a phone call from the seller or dealer agreeing to your terms.</p>
  <p>Dealers will work a lot harder if they think they're going to get a deal so let them know you're there to buy a car if the deal is right. However, don't come across as desperate to buy as this could reduce your chances of picking up a bargain - play it cool.</p>
  <p>Don't forget running costs when buying a car. Diesel cars offer better fuel economy but they cost more to buyer, as does the fuel, so you may need to cover thousands of miles before you save money.</p>
  <p>Make sure any special features or extras you want are included in the price</p>
  <p>Remember your budget - don't get carried away</p>
  <p><strong>Buying a car with cash</strong></p>
  <p>This is the simplest car-buying option if you have the funds to spare. But don't assume that cash is king - car dealers make more money from finance customers.</p>
  <p>If you're buying a new car with cash, don't brag about it. Instead, let the dealer think you are considering finance, until you've agreed the bottom-line price for the car.</p>
  <p>Don't hand over money until you're satisfied with the collection or delivery arrangements.</p>
  <p>Don't be pressured into buying - walk away if you're not completely happy.</p>

  static const String buyingUsedVehicle = '''
<p>We've put together some simple tips in helping you secure your dream car.</p>
<p><strong>Do your research</strong> - Always find out as much information about the car. How much you will have to pay for insurance, fuel, road tax and many others. Are there any common faults with this vehicle that you should check? Of course, in the age and time of the internet, these facts are easier to find than they used to be.</p>
<p><strong>Check the seller</strong> - Once you've found a potential car, there are a few simple things you can do to help check that you are dealing with a legitimate seller. Remember, whilst cars purchased from a dealer will be a little more expensive, you do benefit from certain amount of extra legal protection should there be a problem with your purchase.</p>
<p>When calling a <strong>private seller, </strong>ask about 'the car'. If they ask you 'which car' then you may be dealing with a dealer that is trying to pretend otherwise, thus avoiding their legal obligations. Make sure you are able to visit the car at the seller's home or business premises if they are a dealer.</p>
<p>Ask thorough questions about the car, its past and current conditions.</p>
<p>Always arrange to view a private sale at the seller's house (daytime) or public area and if it's a dealer at their premises.</p>
<p>Don't view a car in the rain, poor light or at night. You won't be able to check the condition of the car properly if it's wet - water hides scratches, dents and other problems therefore make sure you see the car clearly and from all angles. <strong>NEVER VIEW A CAR AT NIGHT FOR SAFETY REASONS</strong></p>
<p>Ask about the service history of the car.</p>
<p>Thoroughly assess the documentation of the car to ensure the authenticity of it.</p>
<p>Be careful of car cloning - In some cases a car can be given the identity of another by replacing the number plate with those from similar identical car - same make, model, year and colour. <strong>Be Warned!</strong></p>
<p>Be wary of anything that seems like a real bargain, or has a very low mileage for its age. There will always be bargains but in general, if a deal looks too good to be true then it most likely is.</p>
<p>Don't be pressured into buying a car. There are always other vehicles out there so if don't satisfied in any way it's time to walk away.</p>
<p>Be wary of and don't be influenced by statements like change of job, moving abroad, relationship break-up, new baby on the way - hence bigger car, etc. etc. The point is you're buying the car to help yourself and not anyone else.</p>
<p>Before you hand over any money, do the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Agree collection/delivery arrangements</li>
<li>Confirm exactly what's included in the price</li>
<li>Confirm any work that the seller has agreed to do</li>
<li>Make sure you get the full documents of the car and a receipt detailing the price, date and time of sale, terms of sales and the seller's details.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Be a good buyer</strong> - Turn up on time for your viewing, make prompt but wise decision (having done all the appropriate checks and always go with someone)</p>

      '''<p>Buying or selling a car or car part/accessories should be an enjoyable and stress free experience, and with AutoTitanic we go the extra mile to ensure that your journey in securing a good and reliable car or car part is made smooth and safe. Our safety advice and tips will ensure you stay secure online, whether you are a buyer or seller of a car or car parts &amp; accessories.</p>
  <p>Keep things local by meeting face to face</p>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>How do I stay safe when using Autotitanic.com?</strong></p>
  <p>We have noticed that one of the best ways to stay safe is to ensure that all transactions take place locally, in-person and with cash. Remember that Autotitanic.com is your local classifieds website and advertisements are not always reviewed before they go live on our site. Therefore, we would advise that you take the following precautionary measures when visiting the Autotitanic.com</p>
  <ul>
<li>When buying or selling, you should always meet in-person to see the vehicle or the part/accessory. Meeting in a public place with many people around is quite essential. If possible, meet at a bank for a safe transaction.</li>
<li>Never send or wire money to sellers or buyers. This includes mailing a cheque or using payment services such as Credit/Debit card, Western Union, Money Gram, PayPal, Google Wallet/Checkout, etc. While this site is very useful and secure, scammers will pretend to use them and even go to the extent of falsifying documents from a legitimate company.</li>
<li>Never give out your personal or banking information over the internet.</li>
<li>Use common sense. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips for Sellers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be prepared</li>
<li>Be careful of scammers - Always meet the buyer</li>
<li>Keep your car keys and documents of the car until payment has been made</li>
<li>Ensure you have two receipts - one for the buyer and keep one for yourself for future reference.</li>
<li>DO NOT meet the buyer in at night or dark place - always meet in open or public area.</li>
<li>&nbsp;DO NOT meet the buyer alone. Always have someone with you and where possible meet in a public area.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips for Buyers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Never send money for a vehicle or vehicle part you haven't seen</li>
<li>Be careful of scammers - Always meet the seller</li>
<li>Ensure all documents are handed to you after sales.</li>
<li>DO NOT meet the seller at night or dark place - always meet in open or public area.</li>
<li>Never send money for a vehicle or part you haven't seen or received.</li>

  static const String safetyCentre =
      '''<p><strong>It is important to be cautious when buying or selling your car online. The following are some few things to look out for:</strong></p>
  <ol>
<li>Is the price of the vehicle much lower than other vehicles of similar years/models? If so, why?</li>
<li>Can you speak with the seller - If not - why not?</li>
<li>Is the content of emails received from buyers/sellers suspicious? Be aware of emails which contain incorrect spelling, punctuation and requests for your personal information - it could be a scam.</li>
<li>If buying: Don't hand over any money before you've seen the car - cash is often the best form of payment. Avoid giving personal information out over email - AfriCarsOnline.com will NEVER ask for your personal details via email.</li>
<li>If selling: Never let a buyer test drive your car alone. Take the keys out of the ignition and keep hold of them when swapping seats.</li>
<li>If selling: Avoid letting the car go before receiving full payment into your bank account and make sure it's available to use - check with your bank first. Try and receive payment inside a bank for a safe sale.</li>
<li>If you have any queries about a buyer/seller that you think maybe suspicious, please contact us by clicking on 'Report this advert' at the end of any advert you are viewing.</li>
<li>NEVER click on a link that has been emailed to you if you do not know / trust the source, for instance, a link&nbsp;that is sent to you in an email from a seller or buyer</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Fraudulent Sellers</strong></p>
<p>A small number of fraudulent adverts have been placed by people posing as sellers. When potential buyers have tried to contact the seller they have found that the phone number is faulty, invalid or constantly diverted to voicemail.</p>
<p>On questioning this point by email the seller informs the customer that they are unable to use the phone and that they can only converse via email.</p>
<p>The seller asks for a deposit or the full price to be wired to them but after they have received the money they create an excuse as to why they cannot release the vehicle, need more money to be transferred or become impossible to contact.</p>
<p>Be cautious if an advert or ensuing emails contain spelling mistakes and/or poor grammar, as this seems to be a trait of fraudulent adverts.</p>
<p>All vehicle buyers should be cautious if a potential seller cannot give you a telephone number or insists on communicating by email only.</p>
<p>Never hand over any money until you've seen the vehicle or are satisfied that the vehicle and seller are genuine. Even then, don't be pressured into giving a large deposit; most genuine dealers will be happy to accept a small deposit to hold a vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Fraudulent Buyers</strong></p>
<p>Vehicle sellers should be aware that thieves may pose as potential buyers. We let you know what to expect and how to deal with the viewing process to avoid being caught out.</p>
<p>Never let the buyer go out for a test drive alone. There's a risk that they won't come back.</p>
<p>Even if they&nbsp;leave you their keys as a security measure 'their' car could be stolen and this is no proof they will return with your vehicle. Also ensure that they have valid insurance cover or you could be liable for any accidents they may have.</p>
<p>Sellers should hold their keys at all times when potential buyers visit their home address. It is also recommended that the seller avoids leaving keys unattended in the ignition as they can be switched for a similar key without the seller realising. This may allow the vehicle to be stolen at a later stage using the original key.</p>
<p>If you receive an email or a phone call from someone who claims that they work for a car-finder service and can find a buyer for your car you should ignore them.<br>
This is another scam.</p>
<p><strong>Fraudulent Import/Export Scams</strong></p>
<p>This scam involves a seller who claims that the vehicle that they are selling is currently situated outside of the country.</p>
<p>The emails that are sent from the 'seller' to the buyer often contain spelling mistakes and poor grammar. The 'seller' may also try to make themselves seem genuine by stating that they are in financial difficulty etc. and use this as reason for the urgency involved in the sale, the unusually low price of the vehicle that they are selling and the lack of telephone contact.</p>
<p>The buyer is often asked to send payment for the vehicle in 2 parts. 50% 'as a deposit' and then 50% on delivery of the car 'after it's been shipped to the buyer's country' However in most cases once the first 50% is sent, the buyer never hears from the seller again and the 50% is lost.</p>
